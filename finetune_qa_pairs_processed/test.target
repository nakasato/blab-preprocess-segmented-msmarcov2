Humoral immunity is mediated by B-cells while cell-mediated immunity is mediated by T-cells. • In the humoral immunity, the B-cells secrete antibodies whereas in the cell-mediated immunity, the T-cells do not secrete receptors. T-cell receptors are bound to the T-cells and the cells themselves bind with antigens. The antibodies are used in the humoral immunity whereas the receptors are used in the cell-mediated immunity to defend against pathogens. • Unlike in the cell-mediated immunity, the antigens are destroyed by B-cell antibodies outside the B-cells in the humoral immunity.
